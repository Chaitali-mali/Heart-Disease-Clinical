🔬 Heart Disease Clinical  | 📊 Power BI Dashboard

I’m excited to share my latest project where I used a Heart Disease Clinical Dataset to build an insightful Power BI dashboard for healthcare analytics! 🫀📈

🧪 Key Clinical Fields:
Age, Anaemia, Creatinine Phosphokinase

Diabetes, Ejection Fraction, High Blood Pressure

Platelets, Serum Creatinine, Serum Sodium

Sex, Smoking, Time of Observation, Death Event

📊 What’s Inside the Dashboard:
✅ Survival Rate Analysis
✅ Gender & Age-Based Risk Factors
✅ Impact of Smoking & Diabetes
✅ Ejection Fraction Trends

This dashboard is designed to help identify critical risk factors and improve data-driven decision-making in healthcare. It simulates real clinical scenarios using synthetic long-format data (1000+ patient records).

🔍 I recently explored a medical dataset where I analyzed serum sodium levels using SQL to identify key health trends.
Here’s a simple but insightful query I wrote to extract the lowest 5 unique serum sodium values, which can help detect potential cases of hyponatremia (low sodium):
